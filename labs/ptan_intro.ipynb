    "# Ptan intro\n",
    "\n",
    "[PTAN](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan) (abbrevation of `PyTorch AgentNet`) is a small library I wrote to simplify RL experiments. It tries to keep the balance between two extremes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. import lib, then write one line to train the DQN (very vivid example is [OpenAI baselines project](https://github.com/openai/baselines/))\n",
    "2. implement everything from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "First approach is very inflexible. It works good when you're using the library the way it supposed to be used. But if you want to do something fancy, you quickly find yourself hacking the lib and fighting with constraints imposed by the author rather than solving the problem you want to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second extreme gives you *too much freedom* and requires implementing replay buffers and trajectory handling over and over again, which is error-prone, boring and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several years ago I was tired of writing replay buffers and decided to implement something in between: not \"the universal RL lib\", but a set of classes to avoid writing boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used ptan to implement all the [examples for the \"Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On\" book](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On/), which include all the major DRL methods, which includes DQN, A3C, all tricks in Rainbow paper, DDPG, D4PG, PPO, TRPO, Acktr and AlphaGo Zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-level overview\n",
    "\n",
    "From the high level, ptan provides you the following entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Agent`: class which knows how to convert batch of observations to batch of actions to be executed. It can contain optional state, in case you need to track some info between consequent actions in one episode (for example, noise params for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck exploration). Normally, you can use [already existing Agent instances](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan/blob/master/ptan/agent.py) or write your own subclass of `BaseAgent`.\n",
    "* `ActionSelector`: small piece of logic which knows how to choose the action from some output of the network. Works in tandem with `Agent` https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan/blob/master/ptan/actions.py\n",
    "* `ExperienceSource` and variations: by using the `Agent` instance and gym environment object can provide information about the trajectory from episodes. In the simplest form it is one single $(a, r, s')$ transition at a time, but functionality goes beyond this. Source file is https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan/blob/master/ptan/experience.py\n",
    "* `ExperienceSourceBuffer` and friends: replay buffers with various characteristics. Includes simple replay buffer and two versions of prioritized replay buffers\n",
    "* various utility classes, like `TargetNet` (both discrete and continuous), wrappers for time-series preprocessing (used for tracking training progress in TensorBoard)\n",
    "* includes wrappers for Gym environments, for example, wrappers for Atari games (copy-pasted from OpenAI baselines with some tweaks): https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan/blob/master/ptan/common/wrappers.py\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's basically it. Total amount of sourse is just ~1500 lines of Python, which is almost nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I'm going to demonstrate how ptan could be used to simplify RL methods implementation."

    "`Agent` abstraction described above allows us to implement environment communications in a generic way. This communication is happening in form of trajectories, produced by applying agent's actions to gym environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "At high level, Experience source classes take the agent instance, environment and provide you step-by step data from the trajectories. Functionality of those clases include:\n",
    "1. support of multiple environments being communicated at the same time. This allows efficient GPU utilization as batch of observations being processed by agent at once.\n",
    "2. trajectory could be preprocessed and presented in a convenient form for further training. For example, there is implementation of sub-trajectory rollouts, which is convenient for DQN and n-step DQN, when we're not interested in intermediate steps in n-step subtrajectories, only in first and last observations + total reward for the subtrajectory.\n",
    "3. support of vectorized environments from OpenAI Universe\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the experience source classes acts as a \"magic black box\" hiding the environment interaction and trajectory handling complexities from the library user. But the overall ptan philosophy is to be flexible and extensible, so, if you want, you can subclass one of existing classes or implement your own version in case of neccessity. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are classes which are provided by the system:\n",
    "* [`ExperienceSource`](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan/blob/master/ptan/experience.py#L18): by using agent and the set of environments produces n-step subtrajectories with all intermediate steps.\n",
    "* [`ExperienceSourceFirstLast`](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan/blob/master/ptan/experience.py#L161): the same as `ExperienceSource`, but instead of full subtrajectory (with all steps) keeps only first and last steps with proper reward accumulation in between. This can save lots of memory in case of N-step DQN or A2C rollouts.\n",
    "* [`ExperienceSourceRollouts`](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan/blob/master/ptan/experience.py#L200): follows A3C rollouts scheme described in Minh's paper about Atari games.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the classes are written to be efficient both in terms of CPU and memory, which is not very important for toy problems, but might become an issue when you want to solve Atari games, keeping 10M samples in replay buffer using commodity hardware.\n"
